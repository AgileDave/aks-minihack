# Microservices Demo

In this exercise, [WeaveWorks](https://weave.works) has created a demo microservices app called ["Sock Shop"](https://microservices-demo.github.io/).

## Pre-Requisites

You will need to create a namespace named `sock-shop` in your AKS cluster.

## Success Criteria

This is a self-contained demo and requires you only to deploy the app to your AKS cluster. You can find the deployment YAML [here](../yaml/08/complete-demo.yaml).

Check out how this demo deploys. Also look at Container Insights in your cluster to see how your application behaves, check out logs, etc.

Enjoy!!!
