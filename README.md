# AKS Mini-Hack

This repository has materials for an introductory mini-hack around standing up an AKS cluster and creating a few simple applications.

Start at the [Student](./student/01-setup-and-acr.md) section to begin the hack.

If you're stuck, most sessions have a [YAML](./yaml) section with working solutions.

Happy Hacking!!
